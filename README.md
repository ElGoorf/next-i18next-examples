# i18next-guide
Examples of i18n with next.js using next-i18next

Live site: https://i18next.notmybase.com/plurals

The purpose of this site is to both demonstrate how to use i18n, but also explains, by demonstration of various language quirks, why it is neccesary! It is done using Next.js as this is the framework I was using while needing to learn i18n. However, since this project was started, there have been some significant updates to Next.js and how it implements i18n which I've nto caught yet up with.
